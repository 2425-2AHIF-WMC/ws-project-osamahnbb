        <h2 style="padding-top: 5rem" id="beluga_sturgeon">Beluga Sturgeon</h2>
        <img src="pics/beluga_sturgeon.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="right-sided-pic"/>
        <p>
            The beluga sturgeon is one of the largest and most ancient freshwater fish species, tracing its lineage back
            over 200 million years. This remarkable fish can grow up to 7.3 meters in length and weigh over 1,600
            kilograms. Beluga sturgeons are anadromous, meaning they migrate between freshwater rivers and the sea for
            spawning.

            They are known for their long lifespan, often exceeding 100 years.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            Beluga sturgeons are sometimes referred to as "living fossils" because their body structure has remained
            relatively unchanged for millions of years. They even have scutes—bony plates along their back and
            sides—that resemble the armor of prehistoric fish, offering a glimpse into the ancient history of aquatic
            life.

        <h2 style="padding-top: 5rem" id="alligator_gar">Alligator Gar</h2>
        <img src="pics/alligator_gar.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="left-sided-pic"/>
        <p style="justify-content: right">
            The alligator gar is a massive freshwater fish native to the rivers, lakes, and estuaries of North America,
            particularly in the southeastern United States. These ancient predators can grow up to 3 meters long and
            weigh over 136 kilograms. Their name comes from their broad, alligator-like snout.

            Alligator gars are often called "living fossils" because their lineage dates back over 100 million years.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            The alligator gar’s eggs are toxic to humans and many predators! This built-in defense mechanism helps
            ensure the survival of their offspring in the wild, deterring potential threats from eating the eggs.

        <h2 style="padding-top: 10rem" id="bull_shark">Bull Shark</h2>
        <img src="pics/bull_shark.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="right-sided-pic"/>
        <p>
            The bull shark is a robust and adaptable predator found in warm, shallow coastal waters and freshwater
            rivers. These sharks are <strong>unique for their ability to thrive in both saltwater and
            freshwater</strong>, thanks to specialized kidneys and glands that regulate their salt levels.

            Bull sharks can grow up to 3.4 meters long and weigh over 227 kilograms.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            Bull sharks are known to give birth in freshwater environments, providing their pups with a safer nursery
            away from larger ocean predators. This unique reproductive strategy increases the chances of survival for
            their young, giving them a head start in life.

        <img src="pics/catfish2.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="left-sided-pic"/>
        <p>
            Catfish, named for their distinctive whisker-like barbels around their mouths, are a diverse group of fish
            found in freshwater and coastal regions worldwide. With over 3,000 species, catfish come in many sizes, from
            the tiny dwarf corydoras to the giant Mekong catfish, which can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) long and weigh
            over 600 pounds (272 kilograms).


            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            Some catfish species, like the walking catfish , can "walk" on land by using their pectoral fins to wriggle
            and move between water bodies. This extraordinary ability helps them survive in environments where water
            sources may dry up temporarily!
