        The great white shark is one of the oceanâ€™s top predators and one of the largest predatory fish in the world, growing up to 20 feet in length and weighing over 4,000 pounds.
        Known for its iconic sharp teeth and powerful build, this shark is found in coastal and offshore waters worldwide, particularly in areas with abundant prey like seals and fish.
        Great whites have excellent senses, including the ability to detect tiny traces of blood in water, and they play a crucial role in maintaining marine ecosystem balance.
        Despite their fearsome reputation, attacks on humans are rare, and they are vulnerable due to threats like overfishing and habitat loss.
