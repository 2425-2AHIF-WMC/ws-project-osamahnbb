    The whale shark is the largest fish in the world, growing up to 60 feet in length.
    Recognizable by its wide, flat head and distinctive white-spotted pattern, this gentle giant is a filter feeder, primarily consuming plankton, small fish, and crustaceans.
    Whale sharks are found in tropical and warm temperate oceans worldwide, often near the surface. Despite their size, they pose no threat to humans and are popular with divers and snorkelers.
    However, they are classified as endangered due to threats like illegal fishing, boat strikes, and habitat loss.
