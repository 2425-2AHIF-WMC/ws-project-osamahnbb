<p style="float: right; width: 45rem;">
    The basking shark is the second-largest fish in the world, reaching lengths of up to 40 feet.
    Despite its massive size, itâ€™s a gentle giant, feeding exclusively on plankton by filtering thousands of gallons of water through its gills as it swims with its mouth wide open.
    Found in temperate oceans worldwide, the basking shark is known for its slow, graceful movements and is often spotted near the surface, "basking" in the sun.
    Though harmless to humans, it faces threats from overfishing and habitat disturbance, making it a vulnerable species.
