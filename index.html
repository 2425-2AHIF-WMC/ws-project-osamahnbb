    <h1 style="padding-top:2rem;">Most famous Giant Fish</h1>
    <p style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">There's plenty of big fish in the sea. These are the 4 most Popular ones (including
        honorable mention):</p>
    <div id="popular-fish">
        <h2>Whale Shark</h2>
        <img src="pics/whale_sharkPIC.jpg" width="600" height="350" class="right-sided-pic"/>
        <p>
            The whale shark is the largest fish in the world, reaching lengths of up to 12 meters or more. Despite their
            massive size they primarily consume small fish. Whale sharks can be found in oceans worldwide.
            Whale sharks are slow swimmers, cruising at around 5 km/h.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            Did you know that whale sharks have around 3,000 tiny teeth, but they don’t use them for eating? These teeth
            are less than 0.2 inches (5 millimeters) long and play no role in their diet. Instead, whale sharks filter
            their food using specialized gill rakers, letting water flow through while trapping plankton and small prey.
        </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 9rem;" id="great_white">Great White Shark</h2>
        <img src="pics/great_whitePIC.jpg" width="600" height="350" class="left-sided-pic"/>
        <p style="justify-content: right;">
            The great white shark is one of the most iconic predators in the ocean, reaching lengths of up to 6 meters
            and weighing over 2,268 kilograms. Great whites are carnivorous and feed primarily on marine mammals, such
            as seals and sea lions, but they also eat fish and carrion.
            With their torpedo-shaped bodies, serrated teeth, and incredible speed—reaching up to 56 km/h —great whites
            are highly effective hunters. They play a critical role in marine ecosystems by keeping prey populations
            balanced and removing weak or sick animals.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            Great white sharks can sense a drop of blood from up to 4.8 kilometers away! This incredible sense of smell
            is part of their acute sensory system —a feature that helps them locate hidden prey.
        </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 9rem;">Basking Shark</h2>
        <img src="pics/basking_sharkPIC.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="right-sided-pic"/>
        <p>
            The basking shark is the second-largest fish in the world, surpassed only by the whale shark. These enormous
            creatures can grow up to 12 meters in length and weigh several tons. Despite their intimidating size,
            basking sharks are harmless to humans. They consume plankton and other tiny organisms by swimming with their
            massive mouths wide open, filtering up to 2,000 tons of water per hour.

            Known for their slow and peaceful movements, these sharks often swim close to the surface, giving them their
            name.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            Basking sharks shed their gill rakers—specialized structures used for filtering food—each year and regrow
            new ones! This annual "replacement" is a unique adaptation that ensures their filtering mechanism remains
            efficient despite wear and tear from constant feeding.
        </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 9rem;">Honorable Mention: Tiger Shark</h2>
        <img src="pics/tiger_sharkPIC.jpg" width="600" height="350" class="left-sided-pic"/>
        <p style="justify-content: right">
            The tiger shark is a large and powerful predator, named for the distinctive tiger-like stripes on its body,
            which fade as the shark matures. These sharks can grow up to 5.5 meters long and weigh over 635 kilograms.
            Known for their varied diet, tiger sharks are often called the "garbage cans of the sea" because they eat
            almost anything, even inedible objects like tires and license plates. This adaptability makes them critical
            to marine ecosystems.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            Tiger sharks have one of the strongest jaws among shark species and can crush the shells of sea turtles with
            ease! Their serrated, curved teeth are perfectly designed for slicing through tough prey, making them one of
            the ocean’s most formidable predators.
