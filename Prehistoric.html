        <img src="pics/leedsicht.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="right-sided-pic"/>
        <p>
            Leedsichthys was a prehistoric fish that lived during the Late Jurassic period,
            approximately 165 million years ago. It is considered one of the largest bony fish to have ever existed,
            with estimates suggesting it could grow up to 16.8m long.

            Leedsichthys had gill rakers—specialized structures in its mouth—to strain massive quantities of plankton
            from seawater, similar to modern filter-feeding fish like whale sharks and basking sharks.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            Because its skeleton was mostly made of cartilage, like modern sharks and rays, fossils of Leedsichthys are
            rare and often incomplete. This has made studying this ancient fish a puzzle for paleontologists, with much
            of its size and lifestyle reconstructed from a few key specimens!

        <p style="justify-content: right">
            Megalodon was a prehistoric shark and one of the largest and most fearsome predators to
            ever swim the oceans. It lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago during the Miocene and Pliocene
            epochs. Estimates suggest megalodon could reach lengths of up to 18 meters, dwarfing even the
            largest modern great white sharks. Its massive jaws, filled with serrated teeth up to 18
            centimeters long, were powerful enough to crush the bones of whales, its primary prey.

            Megalodon was a global predator, thriving in warm, shallow seas and preying on a wide range of marine life.
            Fossilized teeth are its most common remains, often found on beaches and in sediment layers.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            The bite force of megalodon is estimated to have been over 40,000 pounds per square inch (psi), making it
            one of the strongest bites in the history of life on Earth. For comparison, this is over ten times the bite
            force of a modern great white shark!

        <h2 style="padding-top: 10rem" id="mosaurus">Mosasaurus</h2>
        <img src="pics/mosaurus.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="right-sided-pic"/>
        <p>
            Mosasaurus was a massive marine reptile that lived approximately 82 to 66 million years ago
            . Reaching lengths of up to 17 meters, it was one of the largest predators of its
            time, dominating the ancient oceans. Unlike fish or sharks, Mosasaurus was a reptile closely related to
            modern monitor lizards and snakes.

            This apex predator had a streamlined, elongated body, flippers for steering, and a powerful tail fin for
            propulsion. Mosasaurus preyed on a variety of marine creatures, including fish, ammonites, other marine
            reptiles, and even birds.
            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            Mosasaurus had a double-hinged jaw and flexible skull, similar to modern snakes, allowing it to swallow prey
            larger than its head! This incredible adaptation made it a highly effective hunter in the prehistoric
            oceans.

        <p>
            Ichthyosaurus, meaning "fish lizard," was a marine reptile that lived approximately 200 to 190 million years
            ago during the Early Jurassic period. Despite its name, Ichthyosaurus was not a fish but a reptile, adapted
            to life in the oceans. Growing up to 3 meters long, it had a streamlined, dolphin-like body with a
            long snout filled with sharp teeth, perfect for catching fish and squid.

            Fossils of Ichthyosaurus have been found in Europe, providing valuable insights into
            its lifestyle and evolutionary history.


            </br></br>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
            Ichthyosaurus had some of the largest eyes relative to its body size of any animal, giving it exceptional
            vision. This adaptation helped it hunt in deep or dimly lit waters, making it a formidable predator in its
            marine environment.
